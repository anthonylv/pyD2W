/*
 * Drupal to WordPress
 * MySQL file for creating a clean set of WordPress 3.5 tables
 * ready for a migration pass
 *
 * To create this file, setup a new installation of WordPress and configure
 * to suit your preferences. Create a database dump of the tables and rename
 * to the same name as this file. Alternatively, set the get_wordpress_setup_script()
 * function to return the path of your file.
 *
 * The resulting sql dump file can be used to reset your migration to a
 * clean state using the reset action flag e.g.
 *
 * python drupaltowordpress.py -a reset
 *
